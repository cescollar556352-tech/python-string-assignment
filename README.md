Assignment: Interactive Text Analyzer

This Python text analyzer is a simple program that asks the user to enter a sentence and then shows a menu of options to choose from. It was created using Visual Studio Code, with some extensions added to help with writing, debugging, and formatting the code. The program can do several things with the sentence, like reversing it, counting the vowels, checking if it's a palindrome, finding and replacing words, changing the text to title case, splitting it into individual words, showing how often each word appears, and swapping the upper and lower case letters.

It was very challenging doing this assignment at first because I wasnâ€™t very confident with handling and creating a code in Python. But as I worked through it, I learned how to use different functions and got a little bit better at using loops and conditionals. VS Code and its extensions really helped me with debugging and formatting. In the end, I was able to finish the assignment and it was a fun way to learn and practice Python.
